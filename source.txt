HEllO hElLo! HI hI hi! Iâ€™m a nEw GUY heRe! Create your input in a file called source.txt. Your program should read your input, and print out to the terminal window the pirate-translated version of your text. Just to get you started, this spacedWords.py program reads in a file and then prints out space-delimited words one-by-one, so that in principle you could do something with each word if you wished. Feel free to take a look and use this if it is helpful, but remember to type in yourself any code that you use (copying and pasting with the mouse tends to make you skip actually learning it, whereas retyping it seems to get it to sink in better.)
